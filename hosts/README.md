- **Eris** is the name of my desktop computer. Currently it is **not** runnining NixOS but a stripped down install of Windows 11, but I'm hoping to change that in the near future
- **Themis** is the name of my laptop, which is a HP Envy X360 13. Currently runs NixOS with almost no flaws and move away soon!!!)
